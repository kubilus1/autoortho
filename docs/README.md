# AutoOrtho - Automatic orthophotos for X-Plane

Orthophoto satellite imagery is something that has been supported by X-Plane
for some time.  However, this requires a large commitment of storage
space and patience since imagery would need to be downloaded and prepared
ahead of time.

This project provides a way to retrieve only the satellite imagery you need as you fly,
wherever you choose to in the world!
